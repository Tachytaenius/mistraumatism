And suddenly the Sun burst forth into the Universe,
Rays spread far and wide around you,
And with grace the Moon descended into the sky,
In reflexion of what you're too wounded to know,

And suddenly in mercious clemency,
There was no sin
And there was no shame,
And there sealed behind you was the agony
From whence you came.

And the pain of what's been through you
Will be known by any name you need,
With no hardness to make you strong.
Held.

When the Sun lowers, for thisâ€”now,
The Moon may show you how, for when.

And then in a letting be so serene,
Immersed with the witchen techne on the screen,
You awaken embedded in a space that
Curves just so, to heal
Gently.

And when the Sun dims,
When the hymns begin,
Back in the first age,
We will know nostalgic for all.

When one day the Sun fades,
I will know you and call you by your name.
Any name you like.
